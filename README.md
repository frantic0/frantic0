ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Francisco Bernardo, and I'm interested in human-computer interaction, acoustics, computational audio and designing music systems.

- I am a Research Associate in Digital Musical Instrument Design at the [Augmented Instrument Lab](https://instrumentslab.org/people/), part of the [Dyson School of Design Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/) at Imperial College London.

- ðŸ”­ Previously, I worked at the [Multi-Sensory-Devices Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-groups/multi-sensory-devices/research) at University College London, where I developed acoustic metamaterials and ultrasonic phased arrays for futuristic haptic interfaces.

- At the [Experimental Music Technologies Lab](https://www.emutelab.org) at University of Sussex, I developed Web-based livecoding environments for music and machine learning ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¤–. That includes [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) and the [sema-engine](https://github.com/frantic0/sema-engine).

- My PhD in Computer Science from Goldsmiths UoL, focused on interactive machine learning toolkit design for music technologists and audio developers.
