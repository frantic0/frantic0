### Greetings ðŸ––

I'm Francisco Bernardo, I'm interested in human-computer interaction, acoustics, computational audio and music systems design.

- ðŸ”­ I work on ultrasonic phased arrays and acoustic metamaterials for novel haptic interfaces in the [Multi-Sensory-Devices](https://github.com/Multi-Sensory-Devices) group at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), UK.

- ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¤– Previously, I worked on livecoding environments for music and machine learning at Sussex, where I developed [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) and the [sema-engine](https://github.com/frantic0/sema-engine).

- My PhD in Computer Science from Goldsmiths UoL, focused on designing interactive machine learning toolkits for music technologists and audio developers.
