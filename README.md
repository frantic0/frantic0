### Greetings ðŸ––

I'm Francisco Bernardo, I'm interested in human-computer interaction, acoustics, computational audio and music systems design.

- ðŸ”­ Previously, I worked on ultrasonic phased arrays and acoustic metamaterials for novel haptic interfaces in the [Multi-Sensory-Devices](https://github.com/Multi-Sensory-Devices) group at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), UK. At University of Sussex, I worked on Web-based livecoding environments for music and machine learning ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ¤– where I developed [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) and the [sema-engine](https://github.com/frantic0/sema-engine).

- My PhD in Computer Science from Goldsmiths UoL, focused on interactive machine learning toolkit design for music technologists and audio developers.
